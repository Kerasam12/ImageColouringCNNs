# CNN Encoder Decoder with face_images

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adriangar8/Artificial-Intelligence-degree_UAB/blob/master/CNN_Encoder_Decoder_face_images.ipynb)

In the current python notebook, we have executed the construction of an autoencoder model, employing straightforward Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) operations. The principal objective of this process is the reconstruction of color in facial images, utilizing their corresponding grayscale versions as the initial input.

- Dataset: https://github.com/2014mchidamb/DeepColorization/tree/master/face_images
- Model: Convolutional Neural Network

Technical note: The color space used in this implementation is LAB (L for lightness and a and b for the color-opponent dimensions)

*It must be pointed out that in order to be able to execute the the code properly the dataset must be downloaded from the link provided above and ideally it must be ran in google collab as it is set to do it like that.*
